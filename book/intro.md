# Taking a Look at Vue.js

In this very short book we'll take a stroll through Vue.js.

Vue.js is a JavaScript library used to create user-interfaces. Vue.js is similar to React.js in that it doesn't provide what we might consider the whole toolbag you may expect from a "framework" like Angular or Ember.js.

It does however, provide you will lots of goodies to help create JavaScript user-interfaces.

For a really solid introduction to the ideas behind Vue.js, see the [Vue.js: A (Re)Introduction](http://blog.evanyou.me/2015/10/25/vuejs-re-introduction/) blog post.
